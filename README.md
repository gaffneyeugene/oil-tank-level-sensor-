How does git hub work 

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to manage and store code repositories. It provides a user interface that allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes to code, and review and merge code changes.

To use GitHub, you will first need to create a GitHub account and install Git on your local computer. Once you have an account and Git set up, you can create a new code repository on GitHub, or you can "clone" an existing repository from someone else.

To clone a repository, you will need to copy the repository's "clone URL," which you can find on the repository's GitHub page. Then, on your local computer, you can use the Git "clone" command to download a copy of the repository.

Once you have a local copy of the repository, you can start making changes to the code. When you are ready to share your changes with others, you can "commit" your changes and "push" them back to the repository on GitHub. Other developers can then review your changes and "pull" them into their own local copies of the repository.

GitHub also provides a number of features to help developers collaborate, including code review tools, project management tools, and the ability to create and discuss issues.

Oil Tank Level Sensor

This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller flashed with MicroPython to monitor the level of oil in a tank. The level is measured using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and the data is published to the Internet of Things (IoT) platform Thingspeak.com.

Getting Started
To set up this project, you will need the following:

An ESP8266 microcontroller
An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
A computer with the Arduino IDE and the ESP8266 add-on installed
An account on Thingspeak.com
Connect the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the ESP8266 according to the following schematic:
Copy code
HC-SR04 pin 1 (VCC) -> ESP8266 3.3V pin
HC-SR04 pin 2 (Trig) -> ESP8266 GPIO pin 12
HC-SR04 pin 3 (Echo) -> ESP8266 GPIO pin 14
HC-SR04 pin 4 (GND) -> ESP8266 GND pin
Flash the ESP8266 with the MicroPython firmware using the Arduino IDE and the ESP8266 add-on.

Create a new channel on Thingspeak.com and obtain your channel's API key.

Create a new file on the ESP8266 called "secrets.py" and add the following lines, replacing "YOUR-API-KEY" with your Thingspeak API key:

Copy code
api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
Connect the ESP8266 to your WiFi network by creating a file called "boot.py" and adding the following lines, replacing "YOUR-SSID" and "YOUR-PASSWORD" with your WiFi network's SSID and password:
Copy code
import network

sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta_if.active(True)
sta_if.connect("YOUR-SSID", "YOUR-PASSWORD")
Upload the main code file, "main.py," to the ESP8266. This file contains the code that will measure the oil tank level and publish the data to Thingspeak.
Usage
To use the oil tank level sensor, simply power on the ESP8266. The sensor will automatically start measuring the level and publishing the data to Thingspeak.com. You can view the data by logging in to your Thingspeak account and viewing your channel.
